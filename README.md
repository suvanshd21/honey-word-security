# honey-word-security
A secure cab booking app using Honeywords

I have implemented the Honeywords algorithm in this app written using the Django framework. Honeywords are used for verifying the authenticity of the user logging in and can help detect an intruder. In order to run this app, you need to install Python 3.x, Django, MySQL and mysqlclient. Also, create a database in MySQL called HoneyWordDB.
